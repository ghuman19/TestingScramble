How to play:

You will be given a four-by-four-letter map. It could look something like this:
   F   G   Q   A
   I   P   P   Z
   L   T   U   U
   D   E   E   A

The game's goal is to find as many words from the map as possible.

Word Restrictions:
 - The word must be at minimum three letters long.
 - The letters must be adjacent to one another to form words
    - Letters can be diagonally adjacent too
 - A letter can not be repeated right after each other.
    - For example, in the map above, the top left has the letters F, I, and L. You can NOT spell the word FILL by repeating the L twice
    - However, you can double back to letters. For example, on the second row, you can spell PIP, by going from P, to I, and back to P
 - You can not pluralize a word
    - For Example, Tree is a word, but TREES is not.
    
Points:

The size of each word is important and creates a difference in point distribution
 - 3/4 letters long = 1 Point
 - 5 letters long = 2 points
 - 6 letters long = 3 points
 - 7 letters long = 5 points
 - 8 or more letters long = 11 points
